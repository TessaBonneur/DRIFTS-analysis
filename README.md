## Description
This repository contains my DRIFTS_package. Among others, the package can be used to import .dx files, logfiles and GC data from various IR setups.

## Installation 
- clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hojano/DRIFTS-analysis

```

## Usage
Parse DRIFTS files from a folder using:
```python
DRIFTS_spectra = ir.parse_spectra('*path-to-your-file*')
```
Make a quick plot to check: 

```python
ir.quick_plot(DRIFTS_spectra)
```
Combine with logfile:

```python
merged_data = ir.merge_spectra_logfile('*path to spectra*', '*path to logfile*')
